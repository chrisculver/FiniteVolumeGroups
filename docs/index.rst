   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Finite Volume Groups
====================

This package constructs the finite volume rotation groups, from a list of
angles and directions about which the rotation occurs in 3D space.  It also
constructs the irrep matrix for each group element and irrep of the group.  For
basic usage see `examples/basic_usage.py`.  To see how one might project a LQCD
operator to a specific irrep see `examples/pion_projection.py`
